# AE4350-fFinalProject_Connect4-MarMunuera
Project for the course AE4350 - Bio-inspired Intelligence and learning for Aerospace Applications. This project aims to use RL in the board game Connect 4.

## Set up
This project has been coded in MATLAB and requires the following: Reinforcement Learning Toolbox, Deep Learning Toolbox and Parallel Computing Toolbox.

The code is structured into folders.
- Environment -> Contains all the environment matlab files to simulate the different environments presented in the report
- game_environment_functions -> Contains all the functions that carry out sub-processes.
- agent_functions -> Contains all the functions that create agents.
- DQN -> Contains trained agent files and results file
- Images -> Conatins some of the figures extracted and used in the report.
